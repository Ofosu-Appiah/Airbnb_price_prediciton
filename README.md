# Background
Airbnb has been increasingly gaining popularity since 2008 due to its low prices and direct interactions with the local community. This project employed a general linear model (OLS) model to identify the key factors affecting Airbnb listing prices using data sets of 3800 listings in the Airbnb listings of business units in Seattle. The results showed that 66% of variability in price could be accounted for by the independent variable use in the model. The coefficients illustrate a decreasing trend in variables such as room type and distance from the city center while showing increasing trend in property type, number of people the room can accommodate etc
